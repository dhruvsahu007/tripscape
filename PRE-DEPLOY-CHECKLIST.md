- Frontend PM2 starts

---

### Step 3: Verify Services Running

After script completes:

```bash
# Check backend
sudo systemctl status tripscape-backend
# Should show: "active (running)" in green

# Check frontend
pm2 status
# Should show: "online" status

# Test backend API
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"OK",...}

# Test frontend
curl http://localhost:3000
# Should return: HTML content
```

---

### Step 4: Test from Your Browser

Open these URLs in your browser:

- [ ] **Frontend Homepage**: http://54.197.135.238:3000
  - Should load Tripscape homepage with hero section

  - Should show Dubai package details
  
- [ ] **Agent Dashboard**: http://54.197.135.238:3000/agent
  - Should show agent dashboard with connection status
  - Green badge = connected
  - Red badge = check backend WebSocket

---

### Step 5: Test Core Features

#### Test Chatbot:
1. Go to http://54.197.135.238:3000

## Post-Deployment Checks

### Backend Logs
```bash
# View live logs
sudo journalctl -u tripscape-backend -f

# Last 50 lines
sudo journalctl -u tripscape-backend -n 50
```

**Look for:**
- "Application startup complete"
- No errors about missing packages
- No AWS credential errors (if IAM role attached)

---

### Frontend Logs
```bash
# View live logs
pm2 logs tripscape-frontend

# Last 50 lines
pm2 logs tripscape-frontend --lines 50
```

**Look for:**
- "Ready in X ms"
- No build errors
- No connection refused errors

---

### System Resources

Check your t2.small instance isn't overloaded:

```bash
# Install htop
sudo dnf install htop -y

# Monitor resources
htop

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check memory
free -h
```

**Expected:**
- CPU: < 50% when idle
- Memory: ~1-1.5GB used (you have 2GB)
- Disk: < 5GB used

---

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Backend shows "failed" status

```bash
# Check what went wrong
sudo journalctl -u tripscape-backend -n 100 --no-pager

# Common fixes:
# 1. Port in use
sudo lsof -i :8000
sudo systemctl restart tripscape-backend

# 2. Missing dependencies
cd ~/tripscape/backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo systemctl restart tripscape-backend

# 3. Environment file issues
cat ~/tripscape/backend/.env
# Verify CORS_ORIGINS has your EC2 IP
```

---

### ‚ùå Frontend shows "stopped" or "errored"

```bash
# Check error logs
pm2 logs tripscape-frontend --lines 50

# Common fixes:
# 1. Rebuild
cd ~/tripscape/frontend
npm run build
pm2 restart tripscape-frontend

# 2. Port in use
pm2 delete tripscape-frontend
pm2 start npm --name "tripscape-frontend" -- start

# 3. Check environment
cat ~/tripscape/frontend/.env.production
# Verify URLs point to 54.197.135.238
```

---

### ‚ùå Can't access from browser

**Check security group:**
1. EC2 Console ‚Üí Select instance
2. Security tab ‚Üí Check inbound rules
3. Ports 3000 and 8000 must be open to 0.0.0.0/0

**Check services are listening:**
```bash
sudo lsof -i :3000  # Frontend
sudo lsof -i :8000  # Backend
```

---

### ‚ùå WebSocket not connecting (agent dashboard red badge)

**Verify backend is running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

**Check WebSocket endpoint:**
```bash
# Should list WebSocket routes
curl http://localhost:8000/openapi.json | grep -i websocket
```

**Check security group:**
- Port 8000 must be open for WebSocket upgrade

---

### ‚ùå AI Chatbot not responding

**This is because IAM role is NOT attached!**

1. Go to EC2 Console
2. Select instance `i-0712b2b90db56afb7`
3. Actions ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Modify IAM role
4. Attach `tripscape-bedrock-role`
5. **Reboot instance** (Actions ‚Üí Instance state ‚Üí Reboot)
6. After reboot, check logs:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u tripscape-backend -n 50
   ```

---
